### Hello, and welcome to TAGD! ðŸ‘‹

<b>TAGD</b> is an app that uses augmented reality to allow home owners to show guests around their home with ease. In TAGD hosts are given the ability to place tags, AR messages, throughtout their home for guests to view. Guests can then look at these messages through our app's AR camera. We came up with the ideo for TAGD after thinking about the times we've stayed in a home that wasn't ours. It can sometimes be difficult to find things like the wifi password or where to put the recycling. TAGD solves this problem by having visible, informative messages for the guests to clearly see.
